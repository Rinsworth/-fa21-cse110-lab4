1. The bug was that the inputs to the calculateSum function were both strings, so the function would concatenate the two strings rather than add them together. 

2. I would cast num1 and num2 into Numbers before inputting them into calculateSum. Another option would be to cast num1 and num2 to Numbers inside the calculateSum function.
